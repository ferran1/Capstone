    <string name="how_it_works_fragment_txt_1">This is an application to save your favourite songs from the three major music platforms: Spotify, Soundcloud and Youtube. You can add a song to your favourite list by clicking on the FAB button in the right bottom corner. Once you"'"ve clicked on the button, a form will appear. Now go to the song on the platform specific platform and copy the song URL. Once the URL is copied go back to the application and paste the song into the first input field using the button. If the URL is from either Spotify or Youtube you don"'"t have to fill in the other input fields since the application will gather the information from the API. Once you"'"ve added the song, it should appear on the first backlog screen. If you click on a song it will open the URL and if you swipe left on the song it will get deleted. As of now only Spotify songs are playable within the application using the buttons.</string>
